"Aspects at the crossroads of SE?!"
Mario Südholt, FOAL'11, 21 March 2011
-------------------------------------

Crosscutting concerns are ubiquitous in large-scale software systems:
aspects interact with many other concepts relevant for the definition
and execution of such systems. Hence, the foundations of aspects
should benefit from formal methods developed in other domains but
should also contribute to related domains (and, more generally, to the
foundations of SE as a whole). While the former is a cornerstone
within the aspect community, the latter has enjoyed much less
popularity.

In this talk, we first present some issues on the frontier of the
foundations of AOP and related research domains that illustrate their
manifold relationships. We consider, in particular, calculi and formal
properties of aspects, types, and events, both for sequential as well
as concurrent and distributed systems. We then discuss some current
and open issues that point to a more general role of aspects within
the theory of SE.
