The ONCOSHARe project (ONCOlogy big data SHAring for Research) will
demonstrate, through a multidisciplinary cooperation within the
Western CANCEROPOLE network, the feasibility and the added value of a
Cancer Patient Centered Information Common for in-silico research. The
STACK team will work on challenges to the security and the privacy of
user data in this context.

This project is financed by three French regions and will start in the
3rd quarter of 2018.
