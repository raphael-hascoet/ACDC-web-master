## Cache-Based Side-Channel Attacks Detection...

*Mohammad-Mahdi Bazm, Thibaut Sautereau, Marc Lacoste, Mario SÃ¼dholt, Jean-Marc Menaud*

Research on cache-based side-channel attacks shows the security impact
of these attacks on cloud computing. There- fore, the detection of
cache-based side-channel attacks has re- ceived more attention in IaaS
cloud infrastructures because of improvements in the attack
techniques. However, such detection requires high resolution
information, and it is also a challenging task because of the
fine-granularity of the attacks. In this paper, we present an approach
to detect cross-VM cache-based side- channel attacks through using
hardware fine-grained information provided by Intel Cache Monitoring
Technology (CMT) and Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) following
the Gaussian anomaly detection method. The approach shows a high
detection rate with 2% performance overhead on the computing platform.
