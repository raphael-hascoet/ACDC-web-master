## Isolation in Cloud Computing Infrastructures: New Security Challenges

* Mohammad-Mahdi Bazm, Marc Lacoste, Mario SÃ¼dholt, Jean-Marc Menaud

Cloud computing infrastructures are highly based on the sharing of
hardware resources among different clients. The infrastructures
leverage virtualization to share physical resources among several
self- contained execution environments like virtual machines and Linux
containers. Isolation is a core security challenge for such
paradigm. It may be threatened through side-channels, created due to
the sharing of physical resources like caches of the processor or by
mechanisms implemented in the virtualization layer. Side-channel
attacks (SCAs) exploit and use such leaky channels to obtain sensitive
data like kernel information. This paper aims to clarify the nature of
this threat for cloud infrastructures. Current SCAs are done locally
and exploit isolation challenges of virtualized environments to
retrieve sensitive information. In this paper, we also clarify the
concept of distributed side-channel attack (DSCA). We explore how such
attacks can threaten isolation of any virtualized environments such as
cloud computing infrastructures. Finally, we study a set of different
applicable countermeasures for attack mitigation in cloud
infrastructures.
