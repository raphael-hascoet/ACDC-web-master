## Compositional security and privacy for biomedical analyses using shared genetic data

*Mario Südholt and Fatima-zahra Boujdad*

In the context of the Biosphere project that is involved in designing
and implementing a Cloud-based infrastructure for the French
bioinformatics community 
[Institut Français de Bioinformatique]({{"http://www.france-bioinformatique.fr"}}), Mario Südholt, has given an invited talk on how
to secure and privacy-preserving biomedical analyses involving, in
particular, genetic data, using the COSHED approach. This approach,
which is currently developed mainly as part of Fatima-zahra Boujdad's
PhD thesis, enables secure and privacy-preserving workflows for
biomedical analyses to be defined compositionally.

For further information on our approach, see our publication at
[CLOSER 2018]({{"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01692620v2"}}).
